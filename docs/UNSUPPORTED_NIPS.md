# Unsupported NIPs (Gap List)

This file lists NIPs present in the local specs repo (`~/code/nips`) that are not yet implemented in this repository.

Source of truth for supported NIPs: `docs/SUPPORTED_NIPS.md`.


Notes
- This list is generated by diffing the numeric `*.md` files in `~/code/nips` against our `docs/SUPPORTED_NIPS.md` table.
- After implementing a NIP (code and tests), add it to `docs/SUPPORTED_NIPS.md` and remove it from this list in the next update.
