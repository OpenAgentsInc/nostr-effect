# Unsupported NIPs (Gap List)

This file lists NIPs present in the local specs repo (`~/code/nips`) that are not yet implemented in this repository.

Source of truth for supported NIPs: `docs/SUPPORTED_NIPS.md`.

- 12 — `~/code/nips/12.md`
- 38 — `~/code/nips/38.md`
- 55 — `~/code/nips/55.md`
- 77 — `~/code/nips/77.md`

Notes
- This list is generated by diffing the numeric `*.md` files in `~/code/nips` against our `docs/SUPPORTED_NIPS.md` table.
- After implementing a NIP (code and tests), add it to `docs/SUPPORTED_NIPS.md` and remove it from this list in the next update.
